# Assignment E
This is your remote assignment E repository readme file. You are seeing this file because you have successfully accepted the assignment link and GitHub automatically created a remote repository for you. Now you can complete the assignment steps below.

## Objectives
Analyze the design of an assigned website using the Web Design Tips lesson video and Web Design Checklist document available in Brightspace, then create an effective webpage to document your evaluation. In this assignment, quality content, an attractive layout and clean coding all matter.
You can choose from the following local businesses:
  - http://nicolecahoon.com/ 
  - https://phiarchitecture.ca/
  - https://www.glassexp.com/
  - https://jimsclothescloset.ca/
  - http://www.afcconstruction.com/
  - http://www.comoxvalleylifeline.com/
  - https://ascentphysiotherapy.com/
  - https://ambassadortransportation.net/

If you would prefer to choose a business that isn't listed then you need to ask your instructor first, tell them what wesbite you want to analyze and wait for their approval before you start.

## Instructions
Clone this repository onto your local computer.

### Step 1: Plan your evaluation
Explore your chosen business’ website and write a 500-750 word evaluation where you analyze the website’s design, recommend changes and provide a rationale for those changes. You don’t have to discuss every point in the Web Design Checklist document, just discuss the 3 or 4 most important topics that could be addressed to improve the website. Be specific and include screenshots of the website where you highlight the areas of concerns. You could even draw wireframes to explain how you suggest the website content and layout could be improved.

### Step 2: Create a webpage
  1. Create an index.html file and a style.css file.
  2. Write your evaluation in index.html and use HTML to structure your content appropriately. 

### Step 3: Style your layout
Use external CSS to style your content. Your web page styling must follow web typography guidelines (See Web Design Tips video), the content must have clear visual hierarchy and the layout must be clean and approachable. 

Tip: You could set your content a maximum width and set its horizontal margin to auto to center your content on the page. See the CSS Box Model video for details on how to do do that. 

### Step 5: Validate your work
1. Go to https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload to validate your HTML. Take a screenshot
2. Go to https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload to validate your CSS. Take a screenshot.

### Step 5: Submit your work
Complete the following steps from the GitHub and GitHub Desktop Reference Guide:
1. Commit your changes if you’ve made changes since the last commit.
2. Push your changes to GitHub.
3. Submit your assignment in BrightSpace:
You can access the assignment submission tool by navigating to the week’s assignment in the Content Area, or by clicking on Assignments in the main menu. 
    * Click on the assignment submission link and follow the provided instructions. 
    * Don’t forget to answer the questions and attach the screenshots of your final W3 HTML and CSS validation results.
4. If you have been using a lab computer at the Comox Valley Campus to do your work with GitHub Desktop, remember to shutdown or restart the computer before you leave the room, so that other students won’t have access to your repositories.

## Deadlines
Assignments must be submitted before the end of the week but they will only be graded at the end of every unit. Late assignments will not be accepted and will receive an F. You can complete and submit a contract that allows you to extend the deadline for an assignment but you must email it to your instructor a minimum of 48 hrs before the deadline. Deadline extensions are only allowed for those unplanned, unexpected emergencies that life sometimes throws at us, and they will only be approved by your instructor if you follow the correct process. See the Course Info folder in BrightSpace for more info.
